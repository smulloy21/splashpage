				<h3>Background:</h3>
				<p>My educational background is actually in the humanities; I graduated with a BA in Liberal Arts from St. John's College - Annapolis in 2011, a school whose all-required curriculum is based on the "Great Books." Major areas of concentration included philosophy, literature, history of math and science, and a bit of French and Ancient Greek. After graduating, I travelled to Moscow to study Russian, and decided to pursue a PhD in Slavic literature. Over the course of my first year as a graduate student here at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, I've come to realize that academia is not the right path for me, and I've instead started to put my linguistic skills to good use by applying them to web development. </p>
